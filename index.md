## On the mountain (St. Anton, Lech, Zurs)

Mike is the lead on this. He has a friend who spends the winters in St. Anton, so he we will gather local knowledge. We will definitely Ski into St. Christoph one day and hit this place for lunch - [The Hospiz Alm](arlberghospiz-alm.at); you can also slide to the restroom versus walking down the stairs. More suggestions [Here](./mountain-restos.md)
## In Town

Plenty of [options](https://archive.is/O1fmg) for dining in St. Anton.  In the past, we have enjoyed the [Skiing Buddha](http://www.skiingbuddha.at/) for a break from tradition Austrian fare.  For provisions and breakfast stuff, [Spar Supermarkt](https://spar-markt.at/) is close.
